# RGB Game
## Color picking game from Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp w/ Colt Steele

Game notes:
* No Bootstrap or jQuery on this version
* Focus on using event listeners and query selectors 
* Using for loops, functions and if statements for game logic

## Continuing goals
* Make an extra hard version with 9 or 12 squares
* Make code DRYer
* Try with Bootstrap and/or jQuery to compare builds
